# Calculator Icon Placeholder

Since we don't have the actual iconoCalculadora.png image, the calculator uses an emoji (ðŸ§®) as a placeholder.
If you have the actual iconoCalculadora.png image, place it in this assets directory and update the HTML to use:

```html
<img src="assets/iconoCalculadora.png" alt="Calculator Icon" class="calculator-icon">
```

instead of the emoji span element currently in use.

The icon should be approximately 24x24px and will be centered in the circular button.
